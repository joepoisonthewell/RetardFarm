## What is an ADL?
ADL stands for `Architectural Design/Decision Log`. It is a record of the reasoning behind large architectural or technical decisions made in the codebase.
It can be easy for the reasons behind choices to be forgotten.
Keeping a log of important or tricky decisions helps to inform new developers, and stops old ground being retrodden.
